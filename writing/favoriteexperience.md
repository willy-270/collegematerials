One of my most fun experiences on a project was developing a game with a friend. We set out to make a third-person shooter tower defense game, featuring a copyright-friendly version of Shrek defending his home from invaders. We didn't take it too seriously, so it never ended up in a very polished state, but that's what made the process so fun, and I honestly learned a lot. We would add in random jokes and Easter eggs for each other to discover when they pulled the updated version from the repository. We would spend way too many hours putting to life ridiculous ideas or features just because we thought it would be funny. Overall, we both ended up putting hundreds of hours into it, but ultimately decided to just share it with friends and not publish it. However, I don't consider it a waste of time in the slightest.
