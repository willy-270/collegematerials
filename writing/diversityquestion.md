Being from a quite small and rural town, there really aren't many people around me who are interested in the same things that I am, especially to the extent which I am and how much I engage with it in my free time - namely computers, technology, and programming. I'd like to think that this has made me an independent learner who values pursuing what really interests me. Learning has become something I genuinely enjoy and strive to dedicate much of my free time to. I think this is a valuable mindset to have, and I would love to contribute to the University with my enthusiasm for learning and technology. I'm also excited to collaborate with classmates that have diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives on problems, and to connect with people that have similar interests and skills that could compliment mine on projects.
