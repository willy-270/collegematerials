I've been interested in computers and technology for my entire life. From a very young age I had a desire to learn about the technical side of anything that interested me. Over the last few years, I have enjoyed learning the more detailed aspects of this field to expand my knowledge and learn how computers really work. I started self-learning programming to make games, game modifications, websites, and discord bots for personal use with my friends. I also have built several computers and helped my friends to build theirs. I am truly passionate in this field and enjoy developing things just for the sake of developing things. I would love to get a formal education in what I love to do and learn about the more theoretical and mathematical parts of how computers work from the ground up
