I'm really excited for college in a lot of different ways, and there are lots of different aspects that I would define a successful experience for me. There is of course the classes, which I'm truly excited for as I'm genuinely passionate about my field as I've already spent so much time learning about it on my own for fun, it really doesn't feel like work. I'm honestly really excited to learn about these things just for the reason that I find them really interesting. I hope I can put to use everything I learn on personal projects as well. And of course, I also hope that the skills and knowledge I acquire can help me get into a job that I'm actually passionate about, or maybe even be able to work for myself. Another way in which it would be successful to me is meeting new and like- minded people. In my small rural town, I have very few friends that share the same interests as me or pursue them to the degree that I do. In college, I hope to meet many close friends whom I can make good connections with and maybe even do things like collaborate on projects. I find that when you have friends that share the same goal, a lot of motivation comes with it as you inspire each other and work together on things.
