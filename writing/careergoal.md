Ultimately, I would like to be a software engineer in some field, which I have yet to decide specifically. I could definitely see myself developing applications for a company, but ideally I would like to make a living from making and sustaining something of my own. Any kind of tool or software that is useful to enough people, or even a game as I've had lots of fun developing them in the past. I've enjoyed a large range of programming projects with different tools, skills, and languages for each. I hope that in studying computer science, I'll be exposed to more facets of the field where I can find an area that I especially enjoy, and where I can make the most impact in.
